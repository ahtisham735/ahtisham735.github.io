<h3>

<p>

    The Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) is determined by NEPRA based on the difference in fuel prices and generation mix. If the fuel cost for a particular month exceeds the reference cost, an average amount is added to the bill of all consumers. Conversely, if the fuel cost is lower than the reference cost, an average amount is deducted from the bill of all consumers.

    The Financing Cost Surcharge is applicable to all consumers at a rate of 43 paisa per unit. The collected surcharge is used to repay loans associated with power generation and infrastructure projects.
